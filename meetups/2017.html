    <h1>BDD London is back!</h1>

    <p>Starting February 20th BDD London will happen every second month. Lock your calendars:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a href="#feb">Monday, <strong>Feb 20</strong></a></li>
        <li><a href="#apr">Tuesday, <strong>Apr 18</strong></a></li>
        <li>Wed, <strong>June 21</strong></li>
        <li>Wed, <strong>Aug 16</strong></li>
        <li>Wed, <strong>Oct 18</strong></li>
        <li>Wed, <strong>Dec 20</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>You might notice couple of things changed, like our shiny <a href="../assets/logo.png">new logo</a>, shiny <a href="http://www.bddlondon.org">new website</a> or our shiny <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/groups/10631-bdd-london">new venue</a> in the form of SkillsMatter CodeNode.</p>

    <p>What you wouldn’t immediately notice are the under-the-hood changes of the format itself. BDD London started as Behat London - a meeting of Behat users. Fairly quickly we found that the interest of the community was spanning far outside of that cozy single-tool box. We now feel the same in regards to the format of our meetings.</p>

    <p>One of the best meet ups in the last two years were practical events with high levels of collaboration. So we’re now committing to bring more focus on practical and collaborative exercises as part of our meetings. After all, BDD is all about collaboration, isn’t it? We want to create a space for us to think about and discuss the challenges we face.</p>

    <h2 id="feb">February 20th</h2>

    <p>In the spirit of our newly found commitment, we’re doing something fairly different for the first meet up this year.</p>

    <p>First, we’ll start with a quick open-forum discussion that would focus on immediate, real challenges attendees have in regards to breaking collaborative silos. Konstantin, Ciaran and, hopefully, other BDD thinkers will provide their expertise and brain in a clear strive to fight collaboration challenges collaboratively.</p>

    <p>Second, Konstantin and Ciaran will facilitate their <a href="http://stakeholderwhisperer.com/posts/2014/10/introducing-modelling-by-example">Modelling by Example</a> workshop on exploring and defining Ubiquitous Language that should support your conversation in examples. Konstantin and Ciaran already delivered this workshop at multiple conferences to a great acclaim, so don’t lose this opportunity to experience it for free, surrounded by fellow London practitioners.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, we would love if some of you propose some lightning talks to spread between sessions. We are very committed to grow this community by helping you to spread the word. <a href="https://bit.ly/bdd-london-cfp">So here’s our CFP page</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="apr">April 18th</h2>

    <p>Following our calling for more practical, participatory events, we are extremely happy to announce that we have another cool BDD workshop lined up for April. <a href="https://johnfergusonsmart.com/">John Ferguson Smart</a> of <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/bdd-in-action">BDD In Action</a> fame will facilitate his new <a href="https://johnfergusonsmart.com/feature-mapping-a-simpler-path-from-stories-to-executable-acceptance-criteria/">Feature Mapping</a> workshop. Needless to say, we're very excited to both greet John again at BDDLdn and to learn more from him.</p>

    <h3>Feature Mapping – The Fast Track from Stories to Executable Specs</h3>

    <p>Writing good acceptance criteria is one of the keys to effective software delivery. But it’s hard. In this workshop, you will learn about Feature Mapping, a new technique and easy that can help teams write higher quality acceptance criteria more easily. Feature Mapping is an excellent way to build a deep shared understanding of a story's requirements and clear a path to a smooth implementation of automated acceptance tests.</p>
