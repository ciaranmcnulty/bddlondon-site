        <h3>18.30 Intros and Park Bench discussion</h3>

        <h3>19.00 Data Personas - Mike Scott</h3>
            
        <p>Data personas are a way of giving meaningful and memorable names to sets of data used in scenarios. They build on the ideas 
        of personas and contribute to the ubiquitous language. Using data personas allows you to have conversations in a more natural 
        language, for example 'when the user buys a standard luxury car but with the sports pack'.</p>

        <p>In this short talk Mike will introduce the ideas and show practical examples of how data personas can be used.</p>

        <h3>19:20 Sub-Second TDD with a Dash of Honey - Aslak Hellesoy and Josh Chisholm</h3>
            
        <p>When developers can get feedback on a change within a second, productivity goes through the roof. Many developers 
            know how to write fast unit tests, but what about full-stack acceptance tests exercising a GUI, server side domain 
            logic and persistence?

        <p>Having a test pyramid is easier said than done, and with the techniques you'll learn in this session, we think you'll 
            have a better chance actually building one.

        <p>"Honeycomb" is a software architecture pattern that makes it possible to run acceptance tests in many different modes 
            with different tradeoffs: Speed or confidence. One layer or just some.

        <p>You'll be working in pairs on a simple TODO list application that has a honeycomb in place. As you add new functionality 
            you'll be writing and running acceptance tests in fast mode. Occasionally you'll run them in slow mode for maximum confidence.

        <p>To get the most out of this session you should bring your laptop with some software preinstalled:
        <ul>
            <li>Git
            <li>Node.js
            <li>git clone (URL will become available 2 days prior to meetup)
            <li>cd todo-subsecond
            <li>npm install
            <li>Remember your laptop!
        </ul>

        <h2>About BDD London</h2>

        <p>
                Behavior-Driven Development is a software development process that emerged from Test-Driven Development (TDD). Behavior-Driven Development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from Domain-Driven Design and Object-Oriented Analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.
