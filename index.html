        <p>
                Behavior-Driven Development is a software development process that emerged from Test-Driven Development (TDD). Behavior-Driven Development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from Domain-Driven Design and Object-Oriented Analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.
