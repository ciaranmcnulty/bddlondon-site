        <h3>18.45 - Park Bench discussion</h3>

        <p>A discussion about a BDD topic of the day, using a format where everyone can take part!</p>

        <h3>19.15 - Oopsi Mapping workshop with Jenny Martin and Pete Bucknet</h3>

        <p><em>After her great talk for us in 2016, we're extremely happy to welcome Jenny back with Pete for a more interactive
            look at OOPSI Mapping</em></p>

        <p>OOPSI Mapping is a collaborative agile analysis and testing technique.  It’s a mash up of Chris Matt’s
            Feature Injection and Matt Wynne’s Example Mapping.  OOPSI is an outside-in process, standing for Outcome,
            Output, Process, Scenarios, Inputs.  It gives our discovery activities some structure and helps us expertly
            navigate the quickest path to value. The OOPSI technique also helps us see the big picture and avoid user
            story hell.  It joins up nicely with Impact Mapping, Story Mapping and Event Storming. </p>

        <p>If you do it the other way round it ISPOO</p>

        <p>In this highly participative hands-on workshop you’ll work through a case study using specification by
            example and BDD.  We’ll examine the potential pitfalls and challenges of those approaches and then see
            if the OOPSI approach helps us navigate through them with greater confidence</p>
