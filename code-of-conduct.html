<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>

<h2>Events held at CodeNode</h2>

<p>Many of our events are held at CodeNode. All events at this venue are additionally covered by <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/go/code-of-conduct">Skills Matter's Code of Conduct</a>.

<h2>Purpose</h2>

<p>A primary goal of BDD London is to grow our expertise in collaboration and communication. This commitment requires us to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

<p>This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

<p>We invite all those who participate in BDD London activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.


<h2>Expected Behavior</h2>

<p>The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

<ul>
    <li>Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
    <li>Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
    <li>In the spirit of BDD, attempt collaboration before conflict.
    <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
    <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
    <li>Alert organisers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
    <li>Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.
</ul>

<h2>Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<p>The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

<ul>
    <li>Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
    <li>Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
    <li>Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
    <li>Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information ("doxing").
    <li>Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
    <li>Inappropriate photography or recording.
    <li>Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone’s consent before touching them.
    <li>Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
    <li>Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
    <li>Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
    <li>Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
</ul>

<h2>Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior</h2>

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, organisers and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, organisers and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to do so immediately.

<p>Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, organisers and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.
We hope to resolve any problems in a reasonable manner, but if a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

<h2>Reporting Guidelines</h2>

<p>If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by.

<p>You can report an issue via the CoC violation form: <a href="http://bit.ly/bdd-london-coc">http://bit.ly/bdd-london-coc</a>

<p>Additionally, meetup organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe. In the context of in-person events, organizers will also provide escorts as desired by the person experiencing distress.

<h2>Scope</h2>

<p>We expect all community participants (contributors, paid or otherwise; sponsors; and other guests) to abide by this Code of Conduct in all community venues–online and in-person–as well as in all one-on-one communications pertaining to community business.

<p>Specifically this includes but is not limited to the community events, socialising immediately following these events, and the group's slack channels.

<p>This code of conduct and its related procedures also applies to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members
